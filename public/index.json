  "body": "An introduction into the Spacemacs editor for a user with little Vim/Emacs experience.Spacemacs for Beginner Spacemacs is a beginner friendly extension of the very capable editor Emacs. One potential down-side for the beginner is that there is a lot of functionality available and you have to find out what is the most useful first. To help with this Spacemacs has a clever menu system that shows you the available functions and the neccessary key strokes.This text tries to give an introduction into spacemacs for someone who is not familiar with Vim or Emacs. After reading this you should be able to do some productive work with it. The assumption is that you have installed Spacemacs with Evil (Vim) support. Vim has some very powerful and sometimes very cryptic commands, only some of them will be covered in this text. Also the tables you see in the text only give you a selection of commands. The good news is that with Spacemacs you don&amp;rsquo;t have to remember all commands but you can also use the Spacemacs menu (SPC).Executing commands in Spacemacs The main way to execute commands is to press SPC (the space key) and then a kombination of keys for the specific command. Once SPC has been pressed a menu opens that shows the possible keys. E.g. SPC f s saves the current buffer. It is probably worth just to try a few commands that look interesting to you. For your experiments maybe have a file available that you can load just for testing.Opening files There are several ways to open a file, but a good start is the file selector Neotree, activated with SPC f t. Move to the neotree window with SPC 0 and back to the other previous buffer with it&amp;rsquo;s number SPC &amp;lt;window number&amp;gt;.While using neotree   Function key     Show content of a sub-folder RET or l (list?)   Rename a file. r (remane)   Create a new file c (create)   To toggle between hiding and showing hidden (.) files. s    Basic Spacemacs Evil (Vim) commands There are (I am sure but have not made it that far yet) many usefule vim commands to edit your text and work with the editor. I think as a beginner you don&amp;rsquo;t need all of them. So here are some vim commands that are useful to have a good start and which are, I think also quite easy to remember. The vim mode is a so called modal model. This means it has several different modes that are specialised in doing one thing especially good. The Spacemacs documentation describes this very well [LINK].Spacemacs also shows a different colour for the window number depending on your mode. Normal mode (ESC). This is where you execute vim commands and edit text, not to write text. To write text you switch to insert mode. Insert mode (i). Use insert mode to write text. some more basic text editing also works here. Visual mode (v/V) This is where you select text. Change to visual mode and select text. Then execute commands. You can execute vim commands like copy but you can also execute the SPC sommands from spacemacs that are relevant for text selection.  Vim (and Spacemacs uses a Vim emulation) is famous for beeing a modal editor. That means basically it has one mode to write text called insert mode and some other modes to work with and format the text. Hence the name modal editor, there are several modes where different things happen like writing, editing, working with selections. The most important of these functional modes is normal mode. When you start spacemacs it will be in normal mode first. You can see that parts of the mode line are yellow.In normal mode you can use normal keys to execute commands, no need for Ctrl-this or that. E.g. if you want tom copy the char under the cursor, you press y in normal mode. To inset what has been copied press p. If you want to select more than one character as you normally do, you enter visual mode with v, then mark the test to select and press y to copy your selection and afain p to paste.   function normal mode Spacemacs     enter visual mode for selections v    copy (yank) marked selection or char under cursor y    paste (insert) p    cut (delete) character under cursor x    enter visual mode for whole line selections V    enter insert mode to write text. i    leave insert mode to execute commands. ESC    move (or select) to the beginning of the next word w    move (or select) to the end of the current word e     Move cursor in the current buffer    function normal mode alternative     one character left h arrow-left   one row down j arrow-down   one row up k arrow-up   one character right l arrow-right   one word right w Ctrl-arrow-left   one word left b Ctrl-arrow-left    The idea behind the hjkl keys for cursor movement is that the hands have not to move from the base key line of your keyboard to move the cursor. The base row is the middel row of characters on your keyboard. This way your hads do not have to move around so much to reach the arrow-keys or the mouse. However, you can also use the arrow keys. In insert mode the arrow keys, page-up, page-down, Home and End keys can be used.  The clever editing bits So what&amp;rsquo;s all the hype about. so far the vim editor functions have made you switch between insert mode to enter text and normal mode to do some very basic editing. Here now some more clever bits, and they benefit very much form the fact that you can use normal keys as commands in normal mode as opposed to Ctrl-this and Ctrl-that in other editors.In Vim and spacemacs you can combine commands. E.g.Text selection   function keys     select the word under the cursor viw   copy the word under the cursor yiw    viw changes to visual mode and selects the word currently under the cursor. yiw is similar but yancs (copies) the word under the cursor. If you want to see what you copy you can also press viwyText deletion   function keys     cut the current line dd   cut and copy the word under the cursor diw   cut until next . (sentence end) df.    diw works simular to yiw. It deletes the word under the cursor. df. is a clever bit. It deletes everything until it finds the next . You can search for other letters as well.Mind you that all operations with d cut the text and don&amp;rsquo;t just delete it. The current content of your standard clipboard will be overwritten.Add more space Often you want to add more text in your existing document and for that you need space. So here are some useful normal mode commands to add more space.   function      add a new line over the current line [ SPC   add a new line under the current line ] SPC    Mark/unmark lines as comments    function normal mode spacemacs     mark (unmark) a selection as comment gc SPC c l   mark current line as comment gcc     Super bonus function to move in text A very nifty function to jump quickly to text currently displayed in the window is SPC j j. After the second j of the SPC command select the first letter of the text where you want to jump to. So basically look at the word you want to jump to and select it&amp;rsquo;s first letter. All the corresponding letters in the visible text of the window will be marked with a two letter combination. Key in the two colourful letters of the position at the beginning of the word where you want to jump and there you are. It is much more straight foreward than it sounds. Try it.  File handling    function normal mode Spacemacs     save :w SPC f s   close buffer :q SPC b d   save and close buffer :wq     Window handling Windows are the text areas you see in Spacemacs. When you start it is usually one window. You can split the screen to see two or more windows at the same time.Additinally spacemacs uses the term buffer. Every buffer is assigned to one file. You can have a large number of buffers open but only show a few in windows. Also spacemacs always has some internal buffers open like the *Messages buffer.To keep an overview there are several SPC commads to manage windows and buffer. To activate a specific window on your screen you can type SPC &amp;lt;buffer-number&amp;gt;  Close a window or buffer  SPC w d (window delete). This will close the currently active window. The buffer is still open but not visible and you can continue writing at a later time. SPC b d (buffer delete). This will close the buffer (file). That means either you have saved the text or you will be asked to save it and then it is closed. the window however will stay open and a differnt buffer will be shown in this window. Confusingly it can happen that the same buffer (file) is shown in two windows. In that case you probaly don&amp;rsquo;t need all the windows and you can close one with SPC w d or open another file in the second window. To close window and buffer at the same time you can use SPC w x or SPC b x  Show a different buffer (file) in your current window.  If you have several buffer (files) open and want to show a different buffer file in your current window then open the buffer selection screen (SPC b b) to jump to other open buffers (files) To switch back to the last buffer in the current window use SPC TAB  Configuration As mentioned in many places, confiuration in Spacemacs happens in the .spacemacs file. The .spacemacs file is largely split in 6 sections:&amp;hellip;.. some comments at the top (defun dotspacemacs/layers () Dotspacemacs-configuration-layers &amp;hellip; add layers defun dotspacemacs/init &amp;ndash; spacemacs config (defun dotspacemacs/user-init () &amp;ndash; setup for the very start of emacs (defun dotspacemacs/user-config () &amp;ndash; personal user configuration (defun dotspacemacs/emacs-custom-settings () &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t make changes  &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; some stuff at the bottom In the first section you find already predefined configuration functions with default settings. Not so important fo the beginner This is the important bit. Here you can add and remove layers. A core function of Spacemacs Here are all sorts of parameter and switches for Spacemacs. You find a small description of what they do in the comments above. Here you can put settings for the start of Sapcemacs. If in doubt use section 5 though. User settings. Small pieces of code similar to the standards settings in sections 3 to set parameter for Spacemacs. Don&amp;rsquo;t use  Add and remove layers (packages) Hit SPC f e d (file emacs dotfile) to open the .spacemacs file. This is where you can customize everything.Find the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers line.To add latex into the layer list it shcould look like this:dotspacemacs-configuration-layers &amp;#39;( latex other-layer other-layer ) Now spacemacs will load that layer on startup for you, which includes a major mode for editing latex and a bunch of commands. You can now either restart emacs, or hit spc f e R (file emacs reload) to reload your config. Now if you hit SPC f f (file find) and open a latex file you should have some syntax highlighting and latex specific commands.NOTE: the whole large section of standard configuration is called (defun dotspacemacs/layers () whereas the small paragraph where you add your own selection of layers is called dotspacemacs-configuration-layers.If you make changes, save with SPC f s and restart with SPC q R.Good docu to customise SpacemacsUseful links:  An absolute beginners guide to Spacemacs for academic writing ",

  "description": "How to write a simple file for syntax highlighting for any language for the Micro editor",
  "body": "How to write a simple file for syntax highlighting for any language for the Micro editorLanguage highlighting for beginner For a quick overview about syntax highlighting read this documentation for micro colorsThis text gives a simple introduction how to build a syntax highlighting file for micro.The examples of this text cut together gives a template for your own definitions.Before you start you might need a list of keywords for the language you want to define. One option is to find and copy a syntax file from an other editor.However it can also be helpful to just add a few keywords, edit the symbols, get the comments right and be ready.You can probably do many more clever things for your language syntax than is described in this text, but after reading this text you will be able to create a syntax file already.The syntax YAML file Micro syntax files are defined following the YAML configuration syntax. To create a new syntax file create a new file with the ending .yaml.To make your own syntax definition available to Micro you have to add the new syntax file in your home folder into ~/.config/micro/syntax.If you want to comment your syntax definition then you can use # to mark your comments.File header To start some general information are needed. Most importantly the language you want to describe gets defined with filetype:The filetype gets detected by the file ending described with detect:. For advanced users it is also possible to check the first line of the file to determine the filetype. Replace the values in the example with the relevant name and file ending for your new language.With the rules: keyword the actual language description gets started. Please mind that indentation is important. Everything after rules: has to be indented.e.g.filetype: Test-lang detect: filename: &amp;#34;\\\\.tst$&amp;#34; rules: Language keywords In this section you can describe the language keywords. The syntax looks a bit complex at first but you can mostly copy and paste it. There are three section: - -type : defines the types of the language - statement: defines the keywords of the language. YOu can cram all keywords in one statement or split them up on several statements. - special: can be used to highlight certain keywords of a language in a different color to the othe rkeywords. In Ocaml the function definition is worht a special highlight. In Elixir the do and end could be useful to highlight. It is down to you if you want to use it at all and for which keywords.For each of the above sections a string is defined with the relevant keywords: e.g. &amp;quot;\\\\b(?i:(int|float|bool|char|string|unit))\\\\b&amp;quot;. To define your own profile replace the part in the inner brackets () with your own keywords.e.g.- type: &amp;#34;\\\\b(?i:(int|float|bool|char|string|unit))\\\\b&amp;#34; - statement: &amp;#34;\\\\b(if|then|else)\\\\b&amp;#34; - statement: &amp;#34;\\\\b(for|and|or)\\\\b&amp;#34; - special: &amp;#34;\\\\b(let|rec|function|in)\\\\b&amp;#34; Operators, symbols, strings, comments Symbols and operators Symbols are used in many languages for different thing. That said most languages use similar symbols, so from the highlighting perspactive there is not so much difference. Below list of symbols gives you some common symbols and operators. These can be extended for you r language. There is no need to remove unused symbols. They just do not get used.e.g.- symbol: &amp;#34;(\\\\||@|!|:|::|_|~|=|\\\\\\\\|;|\\\\(\\\\)|||\\\\[|\\\\]|\\\\{|\\\\})&amp;#34; - symbol.operator: &amp;#34;(==|/=|&amp;amp;&amp;amp;|\\\\|\\\\||&amp;lt;|&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;=|&amp;gt;=)&amp;#34; Language constants Language constants means words like true that are no statements and cannot be changed. Depending on the language there can be other constants.e.g.- constant: &amp;#34;(Nothing|Just|LT|EQ|GT)&amp;#34; - constant.bool: &amp;#34;\\\\b(true|false)\\\\b&amp;#34; Strings Strings in most languages are within within quotation marks &amp;ldquo; &amp;rdquo; and characters are within singel quote &amp;lsquo; &amp;lsquo;. In this case you can just use the example below. The additional rule is to show additional controls in the string. e.g &amp;ldquo;Hallo /n&amp;rdquo; If your languages does not have that you can also write rules: []e.g.- constant.string: start: &amp;#34;\\&amp;#34;&amp;#34; end: &amp;#34;\\&amp;#34;&amp;#34; skip: &amp;#34;\\\\\\\\.&amp;#34; rules: - constant.specialChar: &amp;#34;\\\\\\\\.&amp;#34; - constant.string: start: &amp;#34;&amp;#39;&amp;#34; end: &amp;#34;&amp;#39;&amp;#34; skip: &amp;#34;\\\\\\\\.&amp;#34; rules: - constant.specialChar: &amp;#34;\\\\\\\\.&amp;#34; Comments Most languages have different symbols for single line and multi liine comments.e.g. for a multi line comment (&amp;hellip;)- comment: start: &amp;#34;\\\\(\\\\*&amp;#34; end: &amp;#34;\\\\*\\\\)&amp;#34; rules: - todo: &amp;#34;(TODO|XXX|FIXME):?&amp;#34; e.g. for a single line comment after # &amp;hellip;- comment: start: &amp;#34;#&amp;#34; end: &amp;#34;$&amp;#34; rules: [] To keep the overview in your syntax file you can and should add some comments. Single line comments in a .yaml file start with #. There are no multi line comments.e.g. for a single line comment with a comment# single line comment # ... - comment: start: &amp;#34;#&amp;#34; end: &amp;#34;$&amp;#34; rules: [] The full example with comments can be found here",

  "name": "A QEMU Virtual machine with a Windows host and a Linux guest",
  "description": "Run a (Arch)Linux system in a QEMU virtual machine on your Windows.",
  "body": "Run a (Arch)Linux system in a QEMU virtual machine on your Windows.Intro This is my first try to use QEMU to run Archlinux in a virtual machine.To use a virtual machine like QEMU can be quite useful for various reasons. - You cannot reinstall something else on you system. You need it as it is. So to install something new is not an option. - You sometimes just want to try a new operationg system without much risk that if anything goes wrong your current system takes dammage.If you have the choice between a system with 32 and 64 bit then choose the 64bit one. The newer 64bis processors have additional processor commands to support virtual machines. Sometimes these virtualization functions still have to be turned on in the BIOS.When talking about virtual machines you find the experessions hosd and guest a lot. - The host is the system that provides the virtual machine. In our case that is the Windows system. - The guest is the operating system that runs in the virtual machine. In our case Archlinux.Also to use QEMU you need to use the Windows command prompt. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it for 15 years, but what you need is really basic so you should be all right.In this article I wan to set up a QEMU virtual machine with a Windows host and a Archlinux guest.When the virtual machine is used I am looking for this kind of configuration: - 2G of RAM memory - 8 GB hard drive (enough for a test, for a system you use you might want more ) - 2 Proccessors - 64MB Video Memory - support for my native display resolution of 1366x768 - Network access - shared drive between guest and host to exchange files - shared clipboard between guest and hostWifi setup is not for the guest Linux required even if you are actually using Wifi for you host computer. The virtual machine will make the network available to the guest as if it is a cable.Install QEMU on Windows You can install QUEMU from their website. The installation is quite straight foreward.After the installation all QEMU commands are in the QEMU folder. However, at least in my case the folder has not been added to the Windows search path. That means the commads will not be found if you just type them into the command prompt.So instead of typing a command you have to be in the QEMU folder and then type ./commandStarting the virtual machine Before you can start to install a new system you need a filesystem that the virtual machine can use and also a linux distribution ISO file.Create a virtual hard drive To be able to install linux it has to has access to a hard drive. For a virtual machine the hadr drive will be emualted by a file on Windows. There are two options for that file: - qcow2 : This format creadet a drive for linux that has exactly the size you specify on the linux guest side. However the Windows file that represents the hard drive will only grow to the size that is needed. So this option saves space but can also be bit slower. - raw : The file uses exactly the sixe on your host Windows drive as you have specified. This option can be a bit quicker.For this article we will use qcow2. You can create the drive whereever you want. I will put is in a sub-folder in QEMU named harddrive. The actually file is called archlinux.hdType this to create the harddrive:./qemu-img create -f qcow2 harddrive\\archlinux.hd 8G  Download a linux distribution to install First you need to download a linux ISO file somewhere. If you are not sure which one you want the distrowatch lists a lot of choices and ranks them by usage. Alsoo some description is given and for some linux distros you can also find some reviews.As the title said, for this article I will use Anarchy Linux. That is basically an installer helper to set up an Archlinux system without the hassel to do it all by hand. It&amp;rsquo;s all driven by menus. Previously Anarchy Linux was also called ArchAnywhere. It is probably helpful if you have set up Archlinux by hand once, but not mandatory. Also some knowledge about using the shell is helpful for Archlinux. It is not difficult though and comes quite natural.If in doubt maybe start with Manjaro. That is a Archlinux based distro that is tailored for ease of use. It is quite popular, has decent documentation and you find a lot of help and forums in in the web.Anarchy Linux can be found hereRun the virtual machine So now that all prepparations are done we can start the QEMU virtual machine. And istall the Linux in the virtual hard drive.qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -cdrom anarchy-cli-1.0.0-x86_64.iso -boot order=d -drive file=harddrive\\archlinux.hd   m: sets the memory available for the VM. Here 2GB, other options could be 512MB or whatever you want to give your Linux system. -boot order=d boot from cdrom rather than from hard drive.  To start and try your shiny new VM you can start it withqemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -boot order=c -drive file=harddrive\\archlinux.hd  Aaand it turns out it is quite slow.Luckily some things can be done. 1. Currently we use only one processor, So that can be increased to two. 2. QEMU needs some Intel libraries to support the hardware acceleration for modern AMD64 (aka X86_64) processors. To use 2 processors add the parameter -smp 2 for 2 processors. That helps but not much.  The second option is to use the parameter -accel hax. There is a Intel package that needs to be present for this parameter to work. Instructions hereThe -accel hax switch does seem to speed up things. Only problem so far is that my Linux installation crashes. Well.to be continued, hopefully dies das",

So with set TERM xterm-256color you add a variable.spectrwm tiling window manager Install withtrizen -S spectrwm  For a first overview the man pages are usefull: man spectrwmFor more XDG integration you could install xdg-utils.First Configuration spectrwm looks in ~/.spectrwm first and then for /etc/spectrwm.conf So if you do not have config file in your home folder yet, copy it from /etccp /etc/spectrwm.conf ~/.spectrwm.conf  For Archlinux the standard bar_font paramenter needs to be updated as described in the WikiTo change keybindings you can copy one of the predefined keyboard mappings in folder /etc/spectrwmTo copy e.g. the us keyboard layout into your .config forlder type:mkdir ~/.config/spectrwm cp cp /etc/spectrwm/spectrwm_us.conf ~/.config/spectrwm/spectrwm_us.conf  To point spectrwm to your new keymapping file you need to update the .spectrwm.conf file.Update keyboard_mapping like this:# This allows you to include pre-defined key bindings for your keyboard layout. keyboard_mapping = ~/.config/spectrwm/.spectrwm_us.conf  Last but not least, change your .xinitrcexec spectrwm  Spectrwm keymap configuration I have found the following keybindings helpful:bind[focus_next]	= MOD+Right # Move to next programme on the same workspace bind[focus_prev]	= MOD+Left bind[term]	= MOD+Return # Start a terminal bind[ws_next]	= MOD+Next bind[ws_prev]	= MOD+Prior  If you use Linux in a Virtual machine on Windows like me then you will find that Win+l is permanently used by Windows to lock the screen. Even if you use VirtualBox. That means MOD+l to grow the master window will also trigger the screen lock. I just use the key next to l to grow the master window. In my case ;For Spectrwm you have to use xkb xharacter names. You can find the name of a character with the tool xev. The output is a bit messy and for ; looks like this: KeyPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,root 0x2bd, subw 0x0, time 64418407, (590,691), root:(1265,692),state 0x0, keycode 47 (keysym 0x3b, semicolon), same_screen YES,XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (3b) &amp;ldquo;;&amp;rdquo;XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (3b) &amp;ldquo;;&amp;rdquo;XFilterEvent returns: False So the xkb keycode for ; is - tada semicolonSo to bind the master_grow command to MOD+; you have to add this line to the keymap file.bind[master_grow]	= MOD+semicolon # Make current window smaller.  Setup for screenshots To make the screenshot function work you have to - copy screenshot.sh from /usr/share/spectrwm to ~/local/bin (or any other place that is in your local PATH) - make sure the screenshot tool scrot is installed - change the config and if you want keymapping",

  "body": "How to create a man page from a README.md fileCreate a (unix) man page with Markdown using pandoc Man pages are application documentation that you find for almost every Unix/BSD/.. system. The format is text based on a markup language called Nroff. The principle concept is similar to Markdown, however the markup language nroff is a quite a bit less readable than markdown. Often variations of the nroff format are used like groff.Man pages are usually used in a terminal. So if you want to see the documentation for the command ls (list files) then you can key in:man ls  and you will see the available options for ls. This works for almost every programme, provided the programme author has written a page.This tutorial describes how to create man documentation pages from a markdown file using pandocUsing pandoc Pandoc is a text conversion tool that can convert text from markdown (or GitHub flavoured markdown ) to groff, a format that is used by the man command to show documentation.Installation of pandoc As pandoc is often not installed as a standard tool you first have to install it on your system. Pandoc should be available from the package manager of your system.For Archlinux type:sudo pacman -S pandoc  Note: The above command installs quite a lot of dependencies on Archlinux. This is because it uses many shared files from Haskell (the programming language pandoc is build with). If you don&amp;rsquo;t have use for Haskell otherwise there is a pandoc version in the AUR called pandoc-bin that does not have these dependencies. You can install that package instead.Create a man page with pandoc To create a man page from markdown we need a markdown file first. Here is an example to start with:# Header 1 Text for this `man** page ## Header 2 **bold text** The last line  Save this file as test.mdTo convert this file into a man page format use this command in the folder where test.md is saved:pandoc --standalone --from gfm --to man test.md --output test.1  The result is in the file test.1 and you can look at the new formal with less test.1. This format is not how the man page will be shown. To see how your new file looks like as a man page, use:man -l test.1  Let&amp;rsquo;s have a quick look at the options of the pandoc command and what they do:&amp;mdash; standalone: creates a complete man page, with complete structure&amp;mdash; from: the format to convert from. In this example gfm (GitHub flavoured markdown) has been specified, but you can also write markdown. for the small differences see the Pandoc documentation&amp;mdash; to: this is the format we want to concert the text to. In this case a man page&amp;mdash; output: the name of the output file. You could also leave this out, then the output goes to stdout.Structure of a man page Now that we can convert markdown to man pages it is worth mentioning that man pages often follow a certain structure. This makes it easier to find information. Of course before you don&amp;rsquo;t publish a man page you can also follow your own structure.There are many header sections, that can be used. Only NAME is seen as mandatory.NAME - The name and a short description of the programme SYNOPSIS - A short summary how to use the programme. e.g.: pandoc [options] [input-file]... DESCRIPTION - Description of the programme OPTIONS - description of options RETURN VALUE - return values of programme once it terminates EXAMPLES - always good to give some examples NOTES - Additional info SEE ALSO - reference to other related programmes AUTHOR - as in author of the programme HISTORY - of the programme if that is helpfulIt is absolutely fine to use only some of these headers like for example: NAME, SYNOPSIS, OPTIONS or any other combination. Remember that NAME is expected.Useful links:  A good introduction into man pages  Creating a man page from a GitHub README.md If you have a README.md in for example GitHub that explains your programme reasonably well you could use that file to create your man page. All you have to do is to add the above headers in the decisive places and the convert the updated file into a man page.pandoc --standalone --from gfm --to man README.md --output prog.1  You might have already noticed the unusual naming convention to end the man page with .1. The number classifies your man page and .1 stands for general.",

  "body": "Setting up LXQt with KWin in Virtualbox using Anarchy Linux#KWin and LXQt and VirtualBoxThis guide describes how to set up KWin and LXQt in Virtualbox using Arch Anywhere.The basic setup should work with any Computer, Virtualbox is just what I use.I have tried to install a relative light version with only a small memory footprint. There might be a more elegant solution though. If someone has an idea, please let me know.Setup VirtualBox  2 cores 2 GB ram (If you can spare that, 1GB also works, I hav not tested with less) Chipset: ICH9 3D acceleration on ? bi-directional copy and paste Display mem 64MB Shared folder (this is nice to have, later I will show how to set up the share)  Run Arch Anywhere Start Arch Anywhere. I have chosen the following setup. Feel free to change. no Wifi: network comes from the host-pc of VirtualBox. no swap partition (a swap file can be set up later if required, I don&amp;rsquo;t have one) Accept virtualbox-guest-additions  Additional apps  VLC: I have chosen that for video  Install  choose LXQT as desktop environment Reboot  After the first boot  login as root Create a user in the terminal &amp;gt; useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio archuser &amp;gt; &amp;gt;passwd archuser Update the system &amp;gt; sudo pacman -Syu Install Kwin &amp;gt; sudo pacman -S kwin Instal Kwin system setting dialog This enanbles the Kwin setting dialog. You can access the setting by clicking in the upper left menu of a window. There you see more actions and in that menu you see &amp;gt; sudo pacman -S kde-cli-tools Kwin-Gtk compability To change the theme of GTK apps in LXQt you need the LXDE appearance app. It has almost no dependencies, so it does not add much. &amp;gt; sudo pacman -S lxappearance In the lxappearance app you can chose the theme the gtk apps use. To see gtk apps with the Kwin Breeze themes add &amp;gt; sudo pacman -S breeze-gtk Fine tuning In my installation I had trouble with changing apps using Alt-Tab. Looking into the logs it turned out an app called kglobalaccel5 was not running. I have no idea where this app should be started but adding it to the LXQt autostart did it for me. &amp;gt; add to LXQt autostart: Menu -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; LXQT settings -&amp;gt; Session Settings &amp;gt; In tab Autostart add kglobalaccel5 to LXQT Autostart  ( If you still have trouble check the Kwin settings in tab Task switcher. The flag current activity has to be set to on )Install additional software This is a selection of mostly Qt software that I found usefull.Browser I have chosen Qupzilla. Serves me well and is relativlely light. &amp;gt; sudo pacman -S qupzillaALternative: &amp;gt; sudo pacman -S firefox###AUR repository To use packages from the AUR repository it is very helpful to use a package managemr for AUR. Pacman does not cover AUR packages. There are many options but I like trizen the best. It works like pacman with some additional functions for AUR packages.git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/trizen.git cd trizen makepkg -si  You can basically replace your use of pacman with trizen. Only for some special cases you can still use pacman.Graphical Editor: howl Install howl ( gui editor) from AUR repository &amp;gt; trizen -S howlYou don&amp;rsquo;t need to use sudo for trizen, you will be asked for the sudo passwd laterImage viewer: LX-Image Install lximage package from AUR repository &amp;gt; trizen -S lximage-qtPDF viewer: qPDFview  trizen -S qpdfview Disk space checker: QDirStat  trizen -S qdirstat Terminal: LX Terminal Many LXQt editions use Qterminal. I like it but some keys are not accessible from programms in the console. So I use LX Termianl which has hardly any dependencies and is a bit smoother in my view. sudo pacman -S lxterminal Console Editor Micro Install Micro from the AUR repository: trizen -S micro-bin Alternative: Console Editor: Tilde Install Tilde (console editor) from AUR repository Tilde is a very user friendly console text editor that uses mostly the same keybindings as graphical apps like Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-V for paste and so on and comes with the menu (Alt-f for the file-menu for example)This package requires the packages fakeroot and pkg_config. Install these packages before you install tilde trizen -S tilde When you install Tilde several libraries will be installed during the process as dependencies. Most called ligt3*, etc.Download the arch-anywhere tool fetchmirrors  trizen -S fetchmirrors Use this tool to set up the right mirror servers for the Arch repositoryfetchmirrors --help for helptrizen PGP Tip If you face a PGP authentication issue using trizen check this:Error message during trizen build is: ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified! :If you trust the package copy the public KEYID from the error message Then use these commands in the console to add the new key: gpg &amp;ndash;recv-key KEYID gpg &amp;ndash;lsign KEYID For details how that works read:Helpful hints, comments and questions are welcome",
