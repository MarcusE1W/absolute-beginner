# Summary

The most flexible operation system to set up a low mouse environment is Linux and Co. The combination of a tiling window manager and Firefox with the extension Saka Key get you quite far to use the computer mostly with a keyboard. Windows and iOS both can be used with a keyboard to a degree. They both have some useful keyboard shortcuts. Windows is the more flexible as expected for a full desktop OS. iOS does surprisingly well for a touch oriented OS and some workflows are have good keyboard support. Unfortunately I have no experience to report for macOS or Android, I would assume the will be similar to Windows and iOS.
