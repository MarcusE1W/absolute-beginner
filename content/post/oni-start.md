An introduction into the new oni editor

<!--more-->
# First impression of the oni editor

## Installation
The installation in Archlinux is really easy. Oni is an AUR package in the moment.  I use the AUR helper `trizen` so my command is:
```bash
trizen -S oni
```

More instructions can be found in the [oni wiki](https://github.com/onivim/oni/wiki/Installation-Guide)

## First Impressions
Oni is an editor that is based on neovim and uses electron and node.js to create a modern graphical user interface. This allows a more modern look and still a decent platform independent development. For those familiar with othe relectron editos like Atom and VScode one interesting question might be how fast `oni` feels in comparison. The good new is that oni starts really quite quick even in my VirtualBox Linux and feels really responsive.
