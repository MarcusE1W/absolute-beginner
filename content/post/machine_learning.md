# What is AI?

A les interesting question than it sounds. There are many academic answers. For this text lets say AI is when a computer

# What is machine learning

Machine Learning (ML) is ...XX

Difference to AI?

# Areas of machine learning.

Superwised learning

Unsuperwised learning

Reinforcement learning

# Technics of machinel learning

## Statistic / stochastic methods

### Regression
### Decision trees
Not the expert system stuff of the 80th.

## Neural networks and Deep Learning

- CNN
- RNN

What are neural networks

What is called deep learning.
Basically a neural network that has a large number of layer, it is therefore deep, hence the experssion deep learning.

# Tools of machine learning

## Libraries for development

## Cloud services
