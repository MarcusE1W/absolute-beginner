A first look at org-mode in Spacemacs


<!--more-->

* Using org-mode like markdown

** Structure documents

 In org mode you structure your document like in markdown with headers.
 Instead of #, ##, ### in markdown you use `*`, `**`, and `***`.


** Org-mode and markdown compared side by side

 | Markdown-mode | Org-mode  | Description       | Example                      |
 |---------------+-----------+-------------------+------------------------------|
 | #             | ~*~         | Header level 1    | ~* Header 1~                |
 | ##            | ~**~        | Header level 2    | ~** Header 2~              |
 | ###           | ~***~       | Header level 3    | ~*** Header 3~             |
 | =_text_=      | ~/text/~    | Italics           | /Hurray/                     |
 | =*text*=      | ~*text*~    | Bold              | *Hurray*                     |
 | N/A           | ~_text_~    | Underline         | _Hurray_                     |
 | ``` txt ```   | ~~text~~    | Code element      | ~Hurray~                             |
 |               | ~=text=~    | Literal           | =Hurray=                             |
 | >             | :         | Single line example | see below |
 | -             | -         | Bullet point list       |                             |
 | 1.            | 1.        | Numbered Lists    |                              |
 | N/A           | -  ::     | Definition list   | - Definition :: rest of line |
 | ~~text~~      | +text+    | Strike through    | +this and that+              |
 | [text](link)  | [[link][description]] |       | [[heise.de][Heise]]                             |

Tests:

* Header 1
** Header 2
*** Header 3
 
 /italics/

 *bold*

 _underline_

 ~source~

 =literal=

 - Bullet list

 1. numbered list

 - definition :: list 1
 - definition :: list 2

 +strike through+

~Source code on one line~

 ~source block, of some sort
 seems not to work ?
 Hm, seems to work a bit different~


Markdown style tasks: (seems not ot work)
 - [ ] hallo
 - [x] hallo



Symbols:
here an arrow \to, a large gamma \Gamma and a \pi.


*** TASK A Task here, this does not look like the right format, should not be a header format for a task ?


#+BEGIN_VERSE
Some verse here 
new line
and more, (does not work, this should be seperated lines?)
#+END_VERSE


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Some quote here 
new line
and more
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_CENTER
Some centered text here 
new line
and more
#+END_CENTER

: Here is an example line for a single line, start with :
usw


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Here is an example block
Some example from a text file.
New line.
So here new line works now, fine.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here is a source code example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun org-xor (a b)
    "Exclusive or."
    (if a (not b) b))
#+END_SRC






* Organise tasks

| Description  | key        | comments                                                               |
|--------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create task  | Ctrl-C RET | This always marks text behind the cursor as a task, not the whole line |
|              | , RET      | This uses the SPC m .. shortcut ,                                      |
| Promote task | Alt-left   | This only works for lines that are already tasks                       |
| Demote task  | Alt-right  | This only works for lines that are already tasks                       |
|              |            |                                                                        |
|              |            |                                                                        |
|              |            |                                                                        |
|              |            |                                                                        |


| Function        | key             |
|-----------------+-----------------|
| demote header   | M-arrow-right   |
| promote header  | M-arrow-left    |
| new header line | Ctrl-RET        |
|                 |                 |
