Set up a Linux ML environment in a Virtualbox on Windows

<!--more-->

# Intro

The intention is to set up a VirtualBox VM on a Windows host. The virtual machine will run Linux and useful software to experiment with machine learning will be installed.

The idea is to use a copy of the virtual machine that can be share so the interested machine learning beginner can start right away after installing VirtualBox.
This approach also allows to set up training and guides that can be easily followed, as every participant has exactly the same environment.

# Set up the VirtualBox on Windows
