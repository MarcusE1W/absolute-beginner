PolyML is a SML functional programming language with parallel programming support.

<!--more-->

* PolyML installation on Archlinux

~sudo pacman -S polyml~

for other options see GitHub [[https://github.com/polyml/polyml][page]]

This gives you:
- *poly* :  The interactive REPL
- *polyc* :  The compiler
- *polyimport* :  import a ml programme and run it, no idea

NOTE: All three commands have /man pages/

* First Impression
- Installation is super straight forward compared to Alice ML
- Compiles to native code
- Documentation only for polyml special features like the thread library
- On first glance the thread library looks a bit old fashioned, it seems like a wrapper for system functions

* Usage

** Tutorials
- Documentation is very limited and restricted to PolyML specific subjects like threads, debugging, etc
** REPL
- The REPL in the ML language context is also called /top level/
- To use a module you have to /open/ it first. e.g.
~open Math~
- To leave the REPL press ~Ctrl-d~
- ~man poly~ for man page
** compile a programme
- polyc to compile
- main function called =main=. e.g.
~fun main() = print "Hello World\n";~

** Debugging

The docu for debugging is quite good. See [[http://www.polyml.org/documentation/Tutorials/Debugging.html][link]]
