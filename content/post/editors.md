# Common keymap editors

This type of editors  is characterised to use quite common key bindings like Ctrl-s for save or Crtl-c for copy.

## Micro (terminal)
- Easy to install, only one binary
## Atom
## Howl
## Brackets
## LightTable
## Textadept
## Cudatext
## VScode


# Emacs style editors

## Emacs (terminal / gui)
## Spacemacs
## mg (terminal)
## QEmacs
## MicroEmacs

# Modal editors

## Kakoune (terminal)
- a new approach to modal editing that starts with the noun, so "word delete" instead of "delete word"

## Vi/Vim/NeoVim (termianl)
- I actually don't use any of these
- obviously vi comes handy as it is installed and almost every Unix like system

## Oni (gui)
- NeoVim with Gui and command palette

# Individual keymap
## nano (terminal)
- standard on almost every Unix system
- the standard editor for those who do not want to use vi
