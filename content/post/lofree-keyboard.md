## How to use iOS with a keyboard

It is fun to write with a keyboard on an iOS device but if you have to tab with your finger on the screen all the time to navigate in the app or to change apps then the flow gets broken easily and the fun fades a bit.

So here are some suggestions how to work with an iOS device and use mostly the keyboard. For this of course the keyboard shortcuts of the last section are very relevant.

### Swap between the last opened apps

This is the same as on other computers. `CMD + Tab` shows a list of the last used apps and flips through. You can use the cursor keys to navigate the list as well.

### Use Spotlight to search for apps and documents
Press `CMD + SPACE` to activate Spotlight, then key in your search.

You can then use the cursor keys to select a result. ENTER will activate the selection.

### Jump to the iOS home screen
You will see the home screen. No idea what that is good for when you use the keyboard. The arrow keys seems not to work. I guess from here it's fingers.

## Open questons
- key repeat in iOS Joplin, and anywhere else? Works with Windows
- Fn also swaps key-layouts
